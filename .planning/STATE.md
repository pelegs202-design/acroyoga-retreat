# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** People can find and connect with the right acroyoga partner near them — by level, role, and skills — and show up to practice together.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase 5 (Quiz Funnels) depends only on Phase 1 — can begin in parallel with Phases 3-4
- Roadmap: Green Invoice needs mandatory pre-phase validation spike before Phase 6 begins (LOW confidence in API docs)
- Roadmap: WhatsApp template approval takes 1-5 days — submit templates during Phase 6 to unblock Phase 7
- Roadmap: Brand name must be resolved in Phase 2 before SEO (Phase 9) and design polish (Phase 10)
- Roadmap: Community cold start — seed 20+ profiles from existing WhatsApp community before public launch (between Phase 3 and public go-live)
- 01-01: role/level user fields use string type not Postgres enum — Better Auth generate unreliable with custom enums; validate at app layer
- 01-01: Better Auth auth route uses toNextJsHandler(auth) pattern (not raw auth.handler)
- 01-01: Next.js 16 dev script uses --webpack flag (not --no-turbopack) for Serwist compatibility
- 01-02: Next.js 16 uses proxy.ts (not middleware.ts) — middleware filename was deprecated in v16
- 01-02: Root layout returns children only (no html/body) — locale layout provides its own html element
- 01-02: Import typed navigation from @/i18n/navigation (not next-intl directly) for type-safe locale routing
- 01-04: swSrc path for Serwist is src/app/sw.ts (not app/sw.ts) — project uses src/ prefix for App Router
- 01-04: sw.ts declares self as any for __SW_MANIFEST — avoids webworker lib requirement in tsconfig
- 01-04: Offline page is self-contained (own html/body, inline styles) — lives outside [locale] segment for cache reliability
- [Phase 01-03]: 01-03: getAuthSession() in every protected Server Component — middleware not trusted for security (CVE-2025-29927)
- [Phase 01-03]: 01-03: tosAcceptedAt updated via raw Drizzle sql tag (not authClient) — input:false additionalField cannot be set through Better Auth client SDK
- 02-01: Plain @theme block used for brand color tokens (not @theme inline) — inline modifier embeds values at build time, breaking runtime CSS variable overrides
- 02-01: Brand tokens use :root --brand variable bridged to @theme --color-brand via var() — preserves runtime CSS variable flexibility while generating Tailwind utilities
- [Phase 02-02]: 02-02: [locale]/layout.tsx uses title template { default: 'AcroHavura', template: '%s | AcroHavura' } — enables per-page title suffixing in future phases
- [Phase 02-02]: 02-02: Password reset email subject is 'Reset your password.' — direct bold voice, period intentional, no brand name in subject
- [Phase 02-03]: 02-03: Offline page wordmark uses inline style hex #F472B6 (not text-brand) — self-contained page outside [locale], Tailwind not guaranteed in cache context
- [Phase 02-03]: 02-03: PWA icon border thickness 15% of icon size — brutalist frame proportion readable at small icon sizes
- [Phase 02-03]: 02-03: Root page.tsx uses bg-background replacing bg-white dark:bg-black — single CSS variable, no light/dark conditionals
- [Phase 03-01]: 03-01: Relations defined after all table declarations to avoid TypeScript forward-reference errors when userRelations references reviews table
- [Phase 03-01]: 03-01: skills text[] default uses sql template tag with '{}'::text[] PostgreSQL array literal — required for correct Drizzle migration SQL
- [Phase 03-01]: 03-01: SKILL_CATEGORIES is a static TypeScript constant (not DB-stored) — user.skills stores move name strings from this list
- [Phase 03-01]: 03-01: Drizzle migration 0000 is the initial full-schema migration — DB was blank, no prior migrations existed; gitignored per project config

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 dependency: Confirm business VAT registration status (Osek Patur / Osek Murshe / Ltd.) before writing any Green Invoice code — determines legally valid document types
- Phase 7 dependency: WhatsApp Business API phone verification (1-3 days) + template approval (1-5 days) — start submission process during Phase 6
